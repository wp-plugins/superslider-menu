    * Added triangles which mark the collapsing and expanding features
      That is, clicking on the triangle collapses or expands, while clicking
      on a month or year links to the archives for the said category.
      This uses html entities (dings) instead of images, for a variety of 
      reasons
    * Lists the titles of posts, instead of just listing subcategories
    * Removed the rel='hide' and rel='show' tags, because they are not xhtml
      1.0 compliant. Now uses the CSS classes instead
		* MOST IMPORTANTLY -- is compatible with both the pre 2.3 database which
		  uses categories, and the 2.3+ database structure which uses the tag
		  taxonomy
